Here I develop a data analysis project that focuses on understanding and analyzing
customer behavior based on transactional data. The goal is to perform Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences,
purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.

I used python here for EDA process

Dataset: Supermarket sales dataset
